To enrich the language, one needs to install and load appropriate libraries. For example, if we want to compute the square root of a number, we need to load a library implementing such function. The same applies to using statistical functions, data manipulation, etc. Libraries in python are loaded using:\n","```python\n","import numpy as np\n","```\n","The most important libraries we will use duing this course are:\n","- numpy (typically as `np`): For numerical anlysis. See [manual](https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/contents.html).\n","- scipy: For scientific computing. See the [scipy lecture notes](http://scipy-lectures.org/index.html). We will extensively use the submodule `stats` of the scipy library for statistical modeling.\n","- pandas:   For data structuring and manipulation. See [documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) and [cheatsheet](http://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf).\n","- matplotlib: For 2D plots.

We will make extensive use of `pandas` during the course. You can think of a `pandas dataframe` as an excel spreadsheet, in which each row is associated to an observation and each column is representing a different feature, or attribute. For example, assume we want to store information about the students of this classroom. We might want to record the name, age, and gpa of each student. Let us create a dataframe, and store the data of a few students. **Note**: Do not forget to import the library before using it!\n","\n","- Step 1:  Create a dataframe with 8 students, with the following:\n",">- names : A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H\n",">- ages: 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28\n",">- gpa: 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5\n","\n","- Step 2: Get a description of the dataframe using `describe()`.\n","- Step 3: Create a scatter plot to describe the relation between age and gpa of students.

For example, assume we want to know what is the average gpa of students, per gender (i.e., **groupped by** gender). What we would need to do is: (i) get all the observations of a given gender, say 'm'. This is a 'filter' operations; (ii) get the `gpa` column, a `select` operations; (iiI) compute the average, i.e., a summary statistic, for the reduced dataset. \n","\n","The `groupby()` function carries out the three operations, for every value of the column `gender`."]},{"metadata":{"id":"90-A96KthOaW","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":197},"outputId":"d0cbf9d3-8a47-4472-f4c5-e80bce3fee41","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1555661889653,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":560,"user":{"displayName":"Marco Caserta","photoUrl":"","userId":"03846663663300323775"}}},"cell_type":"code","source":["myStudents.groupby(by='gender').mean() # this gives the avg of each column\n","myStudents.groupby(by='gender')['gpa'].mean() # this gives the avg of column 'gpa'\n","myStudents.groupby(by='gender').describe() # try this one\n","\n","# get only subgroup 'm'\n","myStudents.groupby(by='gender').get_group('m')"],"execution_count":114,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>name</th>\n","      <th>age</th>\n","      <th>gpa</th>\n","      <th>gender</th>\n","      <th>letter grade</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>A</td>\n","      <td>21</td>\n","      <td>4.0</td>\n","      <td>m</td>\n","      <td>C</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>B</td>\n","      <td>22</td>\n","      <td>4.5</td>\n","      <td>m</td>\n","      <td>C</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>E</td>\n","      <td>25</td>\n","      <td>6.0</td>\n","      <td>m</td>\n","      <td>B</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5</th>\n","      <td>F</td>\n","      <td>26</td>\n","      <td>6.5</td>\n","      <td>m</td>\n","      <td>B</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>6</th>\n","      <td>G</td>\n","      <td>27</td>\n","      <td>7.0</td>\n","      <td>m</td>\n","      <td>A</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["  name  age  gpa gender letter grade\n","0    A   21  4.0      m            C\n","1    B   22  4.5      m            C\n","4    E   25  6.0      m            B\n","5    F   26  6.5      m            B\n","6    G   27  7.0      m            A"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":114}]},{"metadata":{"id":"z9FkIje3sjCA","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Input/Output with Pandas Dataframe\n","\n","In general, we will get the data from different sources, e.g., a web site, an excel file, google drive, etc. Pandas comes with a number of functions to import and export dataset.
